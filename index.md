## Introduction

This webpage is made for a course assignment and it is an example of how to do a github webpage.
It is for collecting the various coding / programming and programming-related courses offered by the University of Helsinki. The list is not exhaustive.

A separate page is dedicated for my learnings from the command-line course organised by the University of Helsinki.
