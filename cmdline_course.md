## Course Introduction

> **Official Course Introduction:** This is a gentle introduction to command-line tools for linguists. It is aimed at bachelor students in languages who are interested in language technology. This course covers the fundamentals of Unix-like command-line environments for linguists.

The Command-Line Course covers introduction to basic unix file and process concepts and also teaches how to navigate in unix file system and how to install and run programs made with different programming languages.

As it is aimed for linguists, the Command-Line Course teaches the basics of text processing and how to write programs which help to analyse text, using gutenberg project books as example material.

The course also includes basics of version control using Git as the example version control system.

## Week 1: Introduction to Command-Line Environments

#### Overview

The main content for this week was to learn how to
*   open and operate the command line
*   create or download files and folders
*   learn to use nano text editor

#### Some command examples using *bash*
```
$ cd <location>       #go to location
$ mkdir <folder_name> #create a folder
$ wget <web location> #download content from the web
$ nano <file_name>    #opening a file with nano file editor
```
> **My learning experience:** Excluding using nano, the content in the week 1 was mostly familiar to me, as I had previously used command line at work and at some other courses.


## Week 2: Navigating a UNIX System

#### Overview

The main content for this week was to learn
*   about files and folders in UNIX file system including links
*   about setting and modifying permissions and about sudo
*   about processes within UNIX system
*   about ssh and working with remote servers

#### Some command examples using *bash*

```
$ chmod <permissions> <file or folder>  #set permissions for a file or folder
$ sudo <command>                        #execute command as super user
$ ssh <server>                          #creating a connection to a remote server
```
> **My learning experience:** This week was still mostly familiar to me. The most challenging was to learn how to use the permissions since the syntax is not them most intuitive.
> This week's XKCD comic explained how SUDO works.
